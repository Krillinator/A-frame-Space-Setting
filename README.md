# A-frame-Space-Setting
A simple world with some basic geometrical shapes. With real-time shadows affected by lighting on the plane.

Originally done as a school project. 

We were originally supposed to create an object from different .mtl files.

I applied what I learned:
	1. Lighting
	2. Shapes
	3. Colors
	4. Objects/Entities
	5. Skies

Afterwards, I got curious about how to use src, realtime shadows and a few new geometrical
shapes. All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out.

Thanks!
